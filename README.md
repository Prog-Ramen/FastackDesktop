Context switching task manager, that organizes tasks based on priority and time. Tasks are added to a stack and items are completed from the top of the stack downwards. Once a task is complete it is popped off the stack. Users can clock in and clock out and the time taken on each task can be recorded. There is also a notes editor that allows users to enter information in markdown format and provides users with the capability to create tables, charts, and uml diagrams.
